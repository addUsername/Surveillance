Server project, its principal mission is to proxy Pi(s) and Client projects. If each user will operate its own server or there will be one server rule them all is undefined yet, first option looks better but the secods justify some Spring cloud, jpa and security.

Wishlist:
- Basic auth & security
- change protocols that allow working with binary data directly (no b64)
- Pi configurer
- divide in restService + auth (server-user), wsService (server-pi), ?? apps
