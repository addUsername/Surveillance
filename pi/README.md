This project is supossed to run in a raspberry pi 4 model B 4GB RAM (Pi OS Lite (32 bit))  and a Pi Camera module.

 `/algo` contains all info about the algorithm used and how to install things, `opencv-contrib-python` will run that detection-thing instead `darknet`, which, remains for training and testing.
 
`/app`  the actual app that runs on RPi, could be more of these kind if new hardware arrives, probably laser sensor and a RPi pico on a 18650 looks good, also lidar seems interesting but it has to be in 2D.. not cool., another simple sensor (smoke, noise, mov) could be attached too.
